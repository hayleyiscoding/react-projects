      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I am curious about people and the world. This curiosity has led me to
        reach my goal of standing on all 7 continents, living on 6 of them and
        visiting over 40 countries. I love to bring remote-work communities
        together. Snowy mountains and beautiful lakes make me happy. I enjoy
        ice-skating, skiing and scuba-diving.
